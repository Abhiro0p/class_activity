## How the Code Works

### Function: `find_cube_pairs(target)`
This function finds all pairs of positive integers (a,b) where a ≤ b and a³ + b³ = target.

1. **Initialize** an empty list `solutions` to store the pairs.
2. **Calculate the upper bound** for our search by computing the cube root of the target number.
   - Since we're looking for pairs where a³ + b³ = target, neither a nor b can be larger than the cube root of target.
3. **Use nested loops** to check all possible combinations of a and b within our bounds.
4. **Check the sum of cubes** for each pair and add valid pairs to our solutions list.
5. **Return** the list of solutions.
